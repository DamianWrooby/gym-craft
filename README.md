## Project Overview

This app is designed to help users create customized fitness plans. By inputting their data, such as fitness goals, current physical condition, and preferences, users can receive tailored workout plans generated with the help of the Chat-GPT model. 

## How does it work?

The user enters data through a clear form and GymCraft under the hood configures the AI model accordingly and enriches that data using prompt engineering techniques to produce the best quality results.

To bypass the Netlify serverless functions 10s timeout when calling external OpenAI API, application uses [GymCraft - Proxy](https://github.com/DamianWrooby/gym-craft-ai-proxy) - additional Express.js server.

## Technologies Used

- **SvelteKit**: A modern framework for building fast and high-performance fullstack web applications.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For generating personalized fitness plans.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Vite**: Build tool for optimized performance.
- **Prisma**: ORM for communication with the database.
- **Skeleton**: UI library.
- **Tailwind**: Utility-first CSS framework.
