This ensures that your body continues to adapt and improve. Each week, you will increase the weight or repetitions for strength exercises, increase the duration or intensity for cardiovascular exercises, and improve flexibility and range of motion for flexibility exercises. The plan also includes rest days and active recovery days to allow for optimal recovery and prevent overtraining. </p><br/><h3 class="h3 text-lg py-2">Justification of Exercises</h3><p>The chosen exercises address the main components of fitness - strength, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. Squats, lunges, deadlifts, push-ups, and pull-ups target major muscle groups for building strength and muscle tone. Jogging, cycling, HIIT, and stair climbing improve cardiovascular fitness and help burn calories. Flexibility exercises such as yoga, stretching, and Pilates improve range of motion and prevent muscle imbalances. Foam rolling is incorporated to aid in recovery and reduce muscle soreness. Overall, this combination of exercises will help you achieve a well-rounded fitness level and reach your goals. </p>';
