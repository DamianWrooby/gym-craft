TEST PLAN GENERATION

Please generate a comprehensive test plan for my project with the following details:

Project Overview:
- Codebase: {{Codebase}}
- Tech Stack: {{TechStack}}
- Repository structure: [Please provide main directories and key files]
- Main application components: [List key components/modules]

Please include in the test plan:
1. Testing scope and priorities based on the project architecture
2. Recommended testing types (unit, integration, e2e, etc.) aligned with the tech stack
3. Critical test scenarios for each major component
4. Technology-specific testing approaches (e.g. specific testing frameworks)
5. Test environment requirements
6. Test data requirements and mocking strategies
7. Performance testing considerations if applicable
8. Security testing requirements if applicable

Additional context to consider:
- Are there any specific areas of concern or high-risk components?
- What is the current test coverage (if any)?
- Are there any existing testing tools or frameworks in place?
